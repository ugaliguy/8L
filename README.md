# A Basic App Using the Google Books API

This is a bare-bones Flask app that uses the [Google books api](https://developers.google.com/books/) to retrieve information about books containing the text entered by the user.

This is a minimally viable product. There is work that still needs to be done.
This includes:
- error handling
- unit tests
- styling of the HTML
- refine the search so that a user can search - for example - by title, author, or isbn
